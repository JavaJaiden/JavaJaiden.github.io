# Project Overview  
Developed **Quick Host**, a high-performance **file hosting service** designed to handle **10,000+ daily user uploads**, ensuring **99.97% uptime and ultra-low latency file retrieval**. The system is optimized for **scalability**, allowing **500+ simultaneous users** to upload and retrieve files with an average response time of **12ms under peak load conditions**.

## Key Features & Performance Metrics  
1. **Scalable RESTful API Design**  
   - Built **efficient API endpoints** capable of handling **high-throughput file uploads** and retrieval requests.  
   - Ensured **seamless performance under heavy loads** using **asynchronous request handling**.  

2. **Performance Optimization & Low-Latency Retrieval**  
   - Achieved an **average response time of 12ms** for file retrieval, even under **high concurrency stress tests**.  
   - Implemented **caching mechanisms** to accelerate frequently requested file access.  

3. **High Availability & Uptime Reliability**  
   - Ensured **99.97% uptime** by implementing **fault-tolerant architecture and redundant cloud storage**.  
   - Deployed **load balancing strategies** to distribute user requests efficiently.  

## Technical Implementation  
### **RESTful API Development & Backend Architecture**  
- Developed API endpoints using **FastAPI (Python) & Flask**, ensuring **asynchronous request handling**.  
- Utilized **SQL & NoSQL databases (PostgreSQL & Redis)** for **optimized file indexing and metadata retrieval**.  

### **Scalability & Load Balancing**  
- Designed system to handle **500+ concurrent users** via **horizontal scaling and multi-threaded request processing**.  
- Integrated **NGINX reverse proxy & API Gateway** to efficiently route traffic and prevent overload.  

## Key Learnings & Achievements  
- **High-Performance API Design:** Engineered **low-latency API architecture** optimized for **real-time file operations**.  
- **Scalability & Concurrency:** Gained expertise in **handling concurrent user requests** efficiently without sacrificing speed.  
- **Cloud Infrastructure & Reliability:** Built a **fault-tolerant system** capable of **maintaining high availability** at scale.  

## Future Enhancements  
- **Integrating AI-powered file categorization & search indexing.**  
- **Expanding storage solutions with distributed cloud infrastructure (AWS S3, GCP, or Azure Blob Storage).**  
- **Enhancing API security with advanced authentication and encryption techniques.**
