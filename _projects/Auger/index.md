# Project Overview  
Led a **company-sponsored project** through **Penn State University** in collaboration with **Wabtec Corporation** to design and prototype an **Auger Drill Attachment** for **Caterpillar 797F mining trucks**. This innovation **combines excavation and hauling into a single vehicle**, improving **efficiency, safety, and sustainability** in open-pit mining.

- **Overview of the project, highlighting the challenges and proposed solution.**  

## Problem Statement  
Traditional mining requires **separate excavators and haul trucks**, resulting in:  
- **Traffic Congestion & Safety Risks:** Overpopulated work zones.  
- **High Fuel Consumption:** Diesel-powered fleets increase CO₂ emissions.  
- **Operational Inefficiency:** Haul trucks remain idle while waiting to be loaded.  

The **797F Auger Drill Attachment** transforms haul trucks into **self-sufficient mining units**, eliminating the need for additional excavation equipment.

- **Concept sketch showing the integration of a drill, conveyor system, and protective guard.**  

## Engineering & Design Process  
### **Path Modifications for Feasibility**  
- Conducted **scaled-down simulations (1:500 ratio)** to test truck maneuverability.  
- Determined that pit mine paths **must be widened by 4.2 feet** at **30-degree curves** to accommodate the drill attachment.  

### **Material Selection for the Drill**  
- Conducted stress simulations on **Aluminum, Steel, and Cast Iron**.  
- **Cast Iron** proved to be the most **durable and effective material** for the drill attachment.

- **Analysis of different materials, confirming Cast Iron as the best option.**  

## Final Design & Prototype  
After testing, we finalized a design featuring:  
- **Auger Drill:** Extracts material efficiently.  
- **Drill Guard:** Prevents debris loss.  
- **Conveyor System:** Transports mined material to the truck’s canopy.  

{% include image-gallery.html images="Project_4_poster (3).jpg" height="400" %}  
- **Final Prototype:** Fully functional auger drill attachment, making the **797F independent during the mining process**.  

## Impact & Future Applications  
By integrating an auger drill attachment into the **797F mining truck**, this project achieves:  
- **Greater efficiency** by eliminating the need for separate excavators.  
- **Reduced emissions** in alignment with Wabtec’s **2030 zero-emission goal**.  
- **Safer mining environments** by reducing vehicle congestion.
